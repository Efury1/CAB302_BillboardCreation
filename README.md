3 Applications:
Billboard Viewer, is a GUI application that will actually display the contents, filling the screen.

It will connect to the Billboard Server, which acts as the central control hub for all billboard viewers connected to it.

Users will run a second client program, the Billboard Control Panel. 
This will be a GUI application that will connect to the server and allow the
user to carry out various management tasks, such as changing which billboards are shown at which
times. The server will store its information in a MariaDB database.
